# Task 003: Keyword Search Engine

## Description

Implement a high-performance keyword search engine that supports multi-pattern matching (exact, partial, regex) with context extraction around found keywords. The engine must handle case-insensitive searches and optimize performance for large HTML content while providing accurate match results with contextual information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exact keyword matching with word boundary detection
- [ ] Partial keyword matching within larger words
- [ ] Regular expression pattern matching with validation
- [ ] Case-insensitive search capabilities across all match types
- [ ] Context extraction (before/after text) around matched keywords
- [ ] Position tracking for match locations in content
- [ ] Performance optimization for large HTML documents
- [ ] Match result ranking and relevance scoring
- [ ] HTML tag stripping for clean text searches
- [ ] Unit tests covering all search patterns and edge cases

## Technical Details

### Multi-Pattern Matching

**Exact Match**:
- Word boundary detection using regex ``
- Case-insensitive flag support
- Multiple keyword search in single pass
- Whole word matching only (no partial matches)

**Partial Match**:
- Substring search within larger words
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Overlapping match detection
- Position offset calculation

**Regex Pattern**:
- User-defined regular expressions
- Pattern validation before execution
- Regex flag support (i, g, m)
- Error handling for malformed patterns
- Timeout protection for complex regex

### Context Extraction

**Contextual Information**:
- Configurable context length (default: 100 characters before/after)
- Word boundary preservation in context
- HTML tag removal from context
- Multiple match consolidation
- Context overlap handling

**Match Metadata**:
- Start and end positions in original content
- Match type identification
- Confidence scoring for relevance
- Surrounding sentence extraction
- Paragraph context when available

### Performance Optimization

**Search Efficiency**:
- Single-pass multi-keyword search
- Content preprocessing and cleaning
- Memory-efficient string operations
- Batch processing for multiple patterns
- Index-based searching for repeated scans

**HTML Processing**:
- Tag stripping with text preservation
- Entity decoding (HTML entities)
- Whitespace normalization
- Script and style tag removal
- Structured content extraction (headers, paragraphs)

### Result Management

**Match Storage**:
- Structured match objects with metadata
- Duplicate match detection and consolidation
- Match ranking by relevance and position
- Grouped results by keyword pattern
- Export formatting for reports

**Search Statistics**:
- Total matches per pattern
- Match density calculations
- Performance metrics (search time)
- Content coverage analysis
- Pattern effectiveness scoring

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (Database models for storing match results)

## Effort Estimate

Medium (16-24 hours)

- Pattern matching implementation: 6-8 hours
- Context extraction and processing: 4-6 hours
- Performance optimization: 3-5 hours
- Testing and validation: 3-5 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three match types (exact, partial, regex) work correctly
- [ ] Case-insensitive search functions across all patterns
- [ ] Context extraction provides meaningful surrounding text
- [ ] Performance handles large HTML documents efficiently
- [ ] Match positions are accurately tracked
- [ ] HTML content is properly cleaned before searching
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95% coverage for search functions
- [ ] Search accuracy meets 99% benchmark for test cases
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during intensive searches
- [ ] Documentation covers all search options and examples
