# PRD: Compliance Keyword Scanner

## Executive Summary

The Compliance Keyword Scanner is a web-based system designed for compliance teams to monitor websites for specific keywords and content. The system automatically generates sitemaps for target domains, then performs comprehensive keyword searches across all discovered pages, providing detailed reports with contextual information for compliance monitoring and analysis.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Compliance teams need to efficiently monitor websites for specific keywords, phrases, or content patterns to ensure regulatory compliance, detect policy violations, or conduct compliance audits. Manual checking of websites is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable for large sites with thousands of pages.

**Why is this important now?**
- Regulatory requirements are increasing across industries
- Manual compliance monitoring doesn't scale with growing web presence
- Need for systematic, repeatable, and auditable compliance processes
- Risk of missing compliance violations due to human oversight

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Compliance Officer
- **Role**: Responsible for ensuring organizational compliance with regulations
- **Goals**: Identify potential compliance issues quickly and systematically
- **Pain Points**: Manual website reviews, incomplete coverage, lack of historical tracking

### User Journeys

**Story 1: Initial Domain Scan**
- As a compliance officer, I want to input a domain and keywords so that I can scan the entire website for compliance issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System generates complete sitemap for the domain
  - All pages are scanned for specified keywords
  - Results include context around found keywords
  - Process runs in background without blocking the interface

**Story 2: Keyword Pattern Search**
- As a compliance officer, I want to use both exact matches and regex patterns so that I can find various forms of sensitive content
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support for exact keyword matching
  - Support for partial string matching
  - Support for regex pattern matching
  - Case-insensitive search capability

**Story 3: Compliance Reporting**
- As a compliance officer, I want to generate detailed reports so that I can document findings for audit purposes
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Web dashboard shows real-time results
  - PDF reports can be generated and downloaded
  - Reports include page URLs, keyword matches, and surrounding context
  - Results are exportable for further analysis

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
1. **Domain Sitemap Generation**
   - Automatically crawl and discover all sub-pages for a given domain
   - Generate sitemap.xml file
   - Handle various URL structures and navigation patterns
   - Respect standard web crawling practices

2. **Keyword Search Engine**
   - Search entire HTML source code of each page
   - Support exact keyword matching
   - Support partial string matching
   - Support regex pattern matching
   - Case-insensitive search options

3. **Web Interface**
   - Input form for domain and keywords
   - Real-time progress tracking for background scans
   - Results display with contextual information
   - Search and filter capabilities for results

4. **Reporting System**
   - Interactive web dashboard for results viewing
   - PDF report generation with detailed findings
   - Context display showing surrounding text for each keyword match
   - Ability to export results in multiple formats

5. **Background Processing**
   - Asynchronous crawling and scanning
   - Queue management for multiple concurrent scans
   - Progress indicators and status updates
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements:**
- Handle domains with thousands of pages
- Support multiple concurrent scans
- Complete typical domain scan (1000 pages) within 30 minutes
- Background processing to maintain responsive UI

**Security Requirements:**
- Only scan publicly accessible websites
- No authentication for password-protected sites
- Secure handling of scan results and reports
- Input validation to prevent malicious domain inputs

**Scalability Requirements:**
- Support multiple users running concurrent scans
- Efficient memory usage during large domain crawls
- Configurable resource limits per scan

**Reliability Requirements:**
- 99% uptime for the web interface
- Graceful handling of unreachable pages or domains
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted scans
- Comprehensive error logging

## Success Criteria

**Primary Metrics:**
- Successfully generate sitemaps for 95% of input domains
- Complete keyword scanning with 99% accuracy
- Generate reports within 5 minutes of scan completion
- Zero false positives in keyword matching

**User Experience Metrics:**
- Users can initiate scans with less than 3 clicks
- Background processing allows continued system use during scans
- Reports provide actionable insights for compliance decisions

**Operational Metrics:**
- System handles peak load of 10 concurrent domain scans
- Average scan completion time under 30 minutes for 1000-page domains
- Less than 1% scan failure rate due to system issues

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- On-premise deployment requirement
- Must work with publicly accessible websites only
- No JavaScript rendering capability (static HTML only)
- Resource limitations based on on-premise hardware

**Business Constraints:**
- Single deployment instance for organization
- No cloud dependencies or external API requirements
- Must integrate with existing security policies

**Assumptions:**
- Target websites follow standard HTML structure
- Compliance keywords are known and definable in advance
- Users have basic web interface skills
- On-premise infrastructure can handle crawling workloads

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- JavaScript-rendered content scanning
- Authentication for password-protected sites
- Real-time continuous monitoring (only on-demand scans)
- Integration with external compliance databases
- Mobile application interface
- Multi-language content translation
- Social media or non-web content scanning
- Automated compliance decision making

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Stable network connectivity for domain crawling
- Target websites must be publicly accessible
- Standard HTML structure on target websites

**Internal Dependencies:**
- On-premise server infrastructure
- Database system for storing scan results
- Web server for hosting the interface
- File system access for report generation

**Team Dependencies:**
- DevOps team for on-premise deployment setup
- Security team for approval of crawling activities
- Compliance team for keyword definition and validation

## Technical Architecture Considerations

**Recommended Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js/Python for crawling and processing
- Frontend: React/Vue.js for web interface
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL for result storage
- Queue System: Redis/RabbitMQ for background processing
- Report Generation: PDF generation libraries
- Web Crawling: Puppeteer/Scrapy for sitemap generation

**Deployment Architecture:**
- Single on-premise server deployment
- Background worker processes for crawling
- Web interface with API backend
- Local database for result persistence
- File system storage for generated reports

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
